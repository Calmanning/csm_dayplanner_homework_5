# csm_dayplanner_homework_5

## The Project and It's functions.

The dayplanner project is working pretty well. It functions as a reliable source to imput data in a live-updated field that responds to current time and reflects the time in the time slots listed on the page, and it saves the users imput's in =to their local storage! However...HOWEVER, it currently is unable to populate the user's saved data back onto the page. So! if they refresh the page or move away from it, the information will no longer show on the page.
